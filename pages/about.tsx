                            Mushroom foraging: This is one of my favourite
                            hobbies. We were lucky to have a safe forest nearby
                            forests around Berlin (many other ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ² in Germany).
                            My favourite mushrooms to eat are the gorgeous
                            Porcini (<em>Boletus edulis</em>) - or Gemeiner
                            Steinpilz in German.

                            real book was a 1947 edition of a field guide to the
                            birds of Scandinavia (written in Swedish). Growing
                            up in north part of Sweden, my parents would take me
                            out on the weekends on birdwatching and foraging
                            trips.

                            In Berlin, I used to have a bed in Templehof where I
                            used to grow a variaty of flowers. It is the best
                            feeling when something starts growing from the soil that you planted.
